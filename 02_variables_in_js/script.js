// this is an example of dynamically typed programming language because we can change the data in a runtime way. first we put a int value then we change it with a string value then again we change it with a floating value. 

// Rules for choosing variable names
/*
-> letters, digits, underscores and & sign allowed

-> Must begin with a $,_ or a letter

-> JavaScript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name 

-> Sihab & SiHAb are different variable (case sensitive)

// let 8num2 = 45; this is not allowed this will throw an error
// let var = 4; this is not allowed
